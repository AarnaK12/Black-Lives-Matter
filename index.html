     &nbsp&nbspThe 2020 covid-19 pandemic had forced changes upon everyone. Schools are closed, most stores are closed, visiting our friends isn't allowed,
      social distancing, and the lockdown. Everyone has changed their lives to a new routine now that there is a lot more time to fit other thinngs in.
       People have started discovering new talents, hobies, and we are even more connected now that we are kept apart.

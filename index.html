     &nbsp&nbspThe 2020 covid-19 pandemic had forced changes upon everyone. Schools are closed, most stores are closed, visiting our friends isn't allowed,
      social distancing, and the lockdown. Everyone has changed their lives to a new routine now that there is a lot more time to fit other thinngs in.
       People have started discovering new talents, hobies, and we are even more connected now that we are kept apart. 
       These are some of the few things I do everyday at home
